			Introducing Calendar</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This should be old news for some, but good news for community I hope. About a
week I uploaded the firsts bits of Gnome Calendar application as sketched
<a href="https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Calendar">here</a>. It just do very few stuff, but it&#8217;s a start. The main design is done,
and I&#8217;ll keep working on it.</p>

<p>The code was uploaded to github at first, but after talking with gnome&#8217;s servers
sysadmins we agree the code could be hosted in <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-calendar">git.gnome.org</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m very happy of getting the project live, I know there&#8217;s a lot of work ahead,
and I&#8217;ll be on it alternating with Gnome Contacts&#8217; work, which is mostly done by
Alex.</p>

<p>I have to thanks all the gnome hackers for its great response.</p>

<p>Keep in touch.</p>

			I&#8217;m on Planet Gnome</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Since last Friday I&#8217;m a proud member of <a href="http://planet.gnome.org">Planet Gnome</a>.
I notice my last two post on Planet Gnome feed, and was a huge joy. After the
initial excitement I realize what a great responsibility encloses the fact of
being able of publish there, and certain fear went deep into my bones.</p>

<p>Anyway, and introduction is mandatory. My name is: Erick Pérez Castellanos, and
I&#8217;m a software developer from Cuba. I studied Computer Science like 4 years ago
or so, and I&#8217;ve been using Linux since for ever it seems. I became involved with
Gnome last year, after wanting to for a very long time. I&#8217;ve been contributing
to Contacts, as you can see here in the archive of the blog, and I&#8217;m planning to
keep on. So, till next time, I&#8217;ll see you around.</p>

			Finished Migration</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I can say the migration is finished. There&#8217;s till my blog online <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>
but that could be left for later. I think on putting a redirect there, or just
taking it down.</p>

<p>The thing is that octopress is a pretty comfortable scheme. It allows me to
write and sanitize my blog at home, or wherever I have my laptop, no matter if
I&#8217;m online or not. The point is I can do a bunch of stuff in my pc without
internet connection, which is a very rare affair in under-developed countries.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s still stuff missing, and I&#8217;ll try to add it on the way. I would like update my twitter
stream with my posts automatically from <strong>rake deploy</strong> task, but since Twitter
now uses OAuth, that became a mess, and I don&#8217;t understand OAuth scheme yet, so
I&#8217;ll have to let it be for a while. I was concern at first for my spelling, but
now anymore, my vim has spell checking, and after change <strong>rake new_post</strong> task
to launch vim with spell checking set on, it&#8217;s way better than Wordpress
correction system.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, so far so good, I like this pretty much, and think is easier
and better than Wordpress. I encourage you people to join.</p>

			Initial Commit</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As you can see, the migration to octopress started with the right foot. The blog
is up and running, and I just have to try three times. That was an easy one. The
first time I installed gentoo, took me about ten times to get it right.</p>

<p>I had some help, some guy named <em>zanshin</em> in <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net#octopress">#octopress at
freenode</a>, and the docs at
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress.org</a>. Now I&#8217;ve installed a new theme, added my
tweets stream, and I&#8217;m on the way to migrate my content from the previous
<a href="http://erick2red.wordpress.com">wordpress blog</a>. I have found a tool named
<a href="https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp">exitwp</a> in some post of another guy in the
same situation, and will test it soon.</p>

<p>You know what&#8217;s missing ? You probably have see all those sites where you make
an account for yourself, and they ask you for an URL, like your site. Well,
I&#8217;ve been putting the wordpress site there. My bad, that should be set on a
central place, now I have to go changing that address everywhere. Maybe I should
make a redirect page in the wordpress blog, although I have to say, I&#8217;ve never
had too many readers.</p>

<p>Ohh, there&#8217;s other stuff missing, one that I probably miss a lot. wordpress.com
have a spell checking utility, well, octopress hasn&#8217;t one. It&#8217;s up to my vim,
and I&#8217;m pretty lazy. Since english isn&#8217;t my mother tongue. I&#8217;ll have to look out
for error and typos.</p>

			Getting Warnings Out of Clutter</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I blogged anything. Well, I actually did some ranting
about starting this new blog. But that really doesn&#8217;t count. I should make a
post saying what I&#8217;ve been up to. But I&#8217;m lazy. I&#8217;ve been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning some Qt (and I doesn&#8217;t like it, maybe I tell something about this
later)</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP">SleekXMPP</a> python library</li>
<li>Learning ruby (Did I said this already ?)</li>
<li>Learning <a href="http://www.clutter-project.org">Clutter</a>, and here we stop.</li>
</ul>


<p>While I was trying to pull some code using Clutter and Gtk+, before you ask, I
was trying to put GtkWidget inside Clutter Actors to get some fancy animation, I
got into some minor troubles, which I think those newbies like me out there
should know.</p>

<p>First, if you read the blog of the might Emmanuele Bassi (Clutter&#8217;s author and
main developer) you then came across this post
<a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/ebassi/2012/03/17/had-a-dream/">Had a dream</a>. I did, and I wanted to get
those warning they talk about so my code would need to be modified pretty much
anything when those API get deprecated. Well, I didn&#8217;t, I mean I used
deprecated API and my compiler wasn&#8217;t throwing me warnings. Someone told me
that I needed to use a decent set of compilers flags, and I tried, nah, still
nothing. I went into IRC, I found help there and after a while, I was told to
add this to my compiler options</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>-DCLUTTER_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED=CLUTTER_VERSION_1_10</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This finally solved the issue and I&#8217;m having pretty warnings  every time I use
an old method which should be destroyed in a couple of months.</p>
