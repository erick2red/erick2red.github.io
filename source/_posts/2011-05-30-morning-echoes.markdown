Here goes some of the morning news you can find around:



	
  * [Gnome-Shell vs Unity vs Others](http://goo.gl/eS8It)

	
  * The [OBS](http://open-build-service.org/) will need a look, since it's kinda a useful service for you providing packages for others distros.

	
  * Great [Linux version bump](http://goo.gl/tUqPs) is coming ?

	
  * [Firefox 5](http://goo.gl/rfIV5) on the way




Some tech now:








	
  * Intel building chips for [Apple ?](http://goo.gl/eV3hM)

	
  * [AMD going for tablets](http://goo.gl/IAEXj). Still a rumor




And some jokes wouldn't kill anyone:








	
  * [Homeownership](http://xkcd.com/905/)




So, monday is kinda slow day, or at least at this time in the morning.




I'll bring you back tomorrow or the day after that.
