I've been using [Archlinux][1] for about 4 years now, and I've been pretty happy
about it. The thing is, as I become more involved in Gnome development, I've feel
the best distro for such a purpose is [Fedora][2].

Now,  you can argue a bunch of
powerful reasons, but the people who package Gnome in Fedora knows
Gnome internals, so the chance you'll end up getting a better experience is
higher. I should tell Gnome packagers in Archlinux to stay a little bit
closer to upstream Gnome developers. Another reason for staying with Arch would
have been to test Gnome across different distros, and I know that would help,
but I felt I needed a change.

There's another point, since I'm dedicating more time now to develop stuff, I
spent less time configuring stuff and tweaking my system, I'm starting to see my
laptop as a tool for development, not the toy it used to be. The only thing I 
require of a distro right now is:

* Having a package of vim. I'll install the plugins myself.
* Having gcc/g++ and the man pages of those. Which I found yesterday I don't
  have in Fedora.
* Having devhelp, and GLib/Gtk+ docs.
* Ohh, and not having **KDE** installed by default.

So, by now, I've been on Fedora for almost a month according to *last*, and I'm
pretty happy with it.

See you soon, to let u know some Calendar advances.
