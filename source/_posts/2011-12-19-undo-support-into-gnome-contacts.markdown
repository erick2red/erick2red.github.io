As of today I uploaded a patch to gnome-contacts to support undo for delete operation.

After a bunch a fixes and reviews from contacts developer Alexander Larsson the patch went up to master. The notification looks good, tough it can become even better, I've already saw two mockups with ways to improve it a little bit. Here's a picture:

This shot shows the new Contact.Pane design work of Alex & Allan.

So, I have to thxs Alex and Allan, and a bunch of people who's been helping me to get this out, eve people from Gtk, Benjamin Otte, Emmanuele Bassi and others.

Hope this contribution don't be the last one. And really hope the notification widget would be included into others gnome apps.
