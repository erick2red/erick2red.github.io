I'm the proud owner of a Gnome Foundation membership. That sounded awfull, anyway. It's true , today the Gnome Fundation Comitee approved my application, and I set up my mail alias.

This is a great news to me, and I think it would be to anyone. There's point you can't miss though, this means more responsibilty doing a good job to make [Gnome Project](http://www.gnome.org) great.
