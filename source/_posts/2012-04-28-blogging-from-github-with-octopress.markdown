Today I've been looking finally at how to deploy an 
[Octopress](http://octopress.org) based blog into [Github](http://github.com).
It's been a while since I saw octopress, and I always liked the motto, 
it goes something like: blogging for hackers, and it sounds cool. I do have to 
say I don't think of myself as a hacker, I'm more the guy who look to dig in 
the code of every piece of software I use, even when I know I don't the time to.

Anyway, after a big while, and my request of my wordpress blog inclusion in 
[Planet Gnome](http://planet.gnome.org) went stalled. I decided to go using 
Octopress, first I emailed the guys in Github since I have my doubts about 
using their system for ranting about stuff not related with ruby/rails and 
stuff. But they said they're fine with that. I do have to say I've been learning
some ruby these past days, there's this [RubyMonk](http://rubymonk.com) site
which is pretty cool, and I found out 
[RubyKoans](http://www.google.com/search?q=rubykoans) too which are pretty
impressive too, although my lack of some supercharged environment is killing my
advance there. Well after all that I think is pretty logic to try this move.
