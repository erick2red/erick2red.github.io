Since I've started developing for a company business I've been using version control systems and for my own projects I choose for git.

Why choose git over others, for was a bunch of simple reason:



	
  * I needed to have a full record of the project, and git is a distributed revision control system, that's fits.

	
  * I tried subversion before, and the branchs management in subversion is lousy, actually there's no branch management, there's just copy to other place, then overwrite/merge. Git branch management is wonderful.

	
  * Lastly, I had to decide between bazaar, Ubuntu's child, mercurial, and git. This was an easy one, who uses git, [Gnome Project](http://git.gnome.org/)Â the [linux kernel](http://git.kernel.org), and [github.com](http://www.github.com), the mighty Octocat, that's a big win for git.


So far, I haven't regretted on my choice, and I don't think I ever will.
