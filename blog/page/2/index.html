			Software Updates</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a very long time since I posted anything.
You might not know, I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba">Santiago de Cuba</a>, Cuba, one of the cities trashed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy">hurricane
Sandy</a>. That left us a bunch of loses and lack of communication for weeks. We went
without power for at least 14 days, so you can imagine why I was not posting updates. Some time has
passed and the city is growing back from its ashes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Calendar"><strong>Calendar</strong></a>, trying to get some minimal functioning
application, to get something out for you to use, and then I can continue
improving the rest. For now, I&#8217;ve focused on enable a fully working the &#8220;Event Details&#8221;
dialog. The thing is kinda clunky yet, but it works. It needs more polish
and heavy testing, though.</p>

<p>I also went and made a year-view implementation, which is almost fully
functional. This one was easy, was almost copy/paste from the old month-view
implementation.
The month-view also received a full face-lift. The previous version had some
super-rough edges when months didn&#8217;t fit in a 35 cells grid. That has been
fixed, our designers pulled some rabbits out of their hats. The new design,
which is already implemented suggest a scrolling
animation, but I want to be sure it works before going into it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to get <strong>Calendar</strong> in beta
shape for 3.8 release. I&#8217;m still need to implement three views: list-view,
day-view and week-view, and the search mechanism, with the results showing.
For the week-view I have an implementation which have scrolling issues,
I have to take care of.</p>

<p>Some minor mojo I don&#8217;t want to pass unnoticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Squared buttons in the toolbar, thxs to Debarshy Ray for the suggestion and Cosimo&#8217;s libgd for the hack.</li>
<li>We added a proper use of <code>g_clear_object</code></li>
<li>Simple keyboard shortcuts, for <strong>Quit</strong> and change amount views.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now some screenshots</p>

			A Challenge of Locales</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When developing an application aiming for everyone worldwide to use, there are certain challenges
you will face. Right now, mine is fighting laziness and locales.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m developing some widget for specifying a date and I&#8217;ve been struggling with date formats across locales
So, after reading a huge number of manpages, source-code, and so on I stumble on this code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  setlocale(LC_ALL,"");
  printf("%s\n",nl_langinfo(D_FMT));
  exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will show me your date format according to your locale.
What I will ask, compile and run this code in your pc, and post the answer here along with your locales.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Thxs for the comments. Two things: I&#8217;ve just updated the code, thxs to Tom, adding <strong>setlocale</strong> line made the code works. Second: Thxs to Tommi (first comment). That was the info I was looking for.</p>

			Making You Own Widget</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few days ago, I was in <a href="irc://irc.gnome.org/gtk+">gtk+ irc channel</a> and there was someone making the
kind of question I&#8217;ve done myself like a hundred times. Thankfully the guys
in the channel hasn&#8217;t got tired of me, yet. They are pretty helpful once they
realize you&#8217;ve done your homework.</p>

<p>Once you start hacking around with Gtk+, the next thing you&#8217;ll want to do
is to make your own widgets. And for that there&#8217;s little to none documentation,
guides or tutorial. There&#8217;s a huge amount of knowledge in Gtk+ source itself, but most
people doesn&#8217;t like to read code, or doesn&#8217;t know how to. They should, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/04/learn-to-read-the-source-luke.html" title="Read the Source, Luke">though</a></p>

<p>Here I&#8217;ll try to show, from the newbie point, how Gtk+ draw things,
and what&#8217;s the guidelines to accomplish certain tasks when making
widgets for Gtk+. This is, as well, a reminder for myself, since most times I
need to go into IRC to ask the same things all over again.</p>

<p>I will split the post in three main sections which corresponds to the important
parts in a widget lifetime.</p>

<h4>Size handling</h4>

<p>One of the thing you need when you&#8217;re making widgets is knowing the
dimensions everything will have inside. Size requisition and allocation is the
step where this happens.</p>

<p>Explanations of this process appears here in <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#GtkWidget.description">GtkWidget&#8217;s documentation</a>.
It includes most of the size requisition process and geometry management.</p>

<p>Gtk+ widgets are arranged in a hierarchy where container widgets pack others
and handle its size and allocation. The widget containing yours will ask the
natural and minimal size you want to have, and after making some internal
calculations will assign your widget a size and allocation. The first
part is called <em>size requisition</em> and the second <em>size allocation</em>. The
virtual methods you need to implement here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>For size requisition</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-preferred-width"><code>gtk_widget_get_preferred_width</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-preferred-width-for-height"><code>gtk_widget_get_preferred_width_for_height</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-get-preferred-height"><code>gtk_widget_get_preferred_height</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-size-allocate"><code>gtk_widget_get_preferred_height_for_width</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><em>For size allocation</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkWidget.html#gtk-widget-size-allocate"><code>gtk_widget_size_allocate</code></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, what to do on each one of these methods ?, Calculate what size you want for
the widget, and return it. Let&#8217;s say you have a widget which have a text saying
<strong>&#8220;Hello&#8221;</strong> inside, then, you need to ask <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/stable/pango">Pango</a> to calculate the width and
height for you, add the margins and padding (if you want to take those into
account) and return the size accordingly.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s width-for-height and height-for-width methods for ?, Widget have by
definition one request-mode, its width depends on its height or the other way
around. This is totally decided by you, accordingly to the type of widget you&#8217;re
creating. The purpose of these methods is to retrieve these measures, the width
of a widget given a specified height, and viceversa. About this part,
read carefully the docs above and go asking in the IRC for more help if stuck.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the allocated size to your widget, could be
not the same you requested in the <code>get_preferred</code> methods, so the widget should
work with the given allocation instead of any other measure.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb</em>: Implement the four methods of size requisition almost always,
and the size-allocate one if needed.</p>

<h4>Drawing stuff</h4>

<p>This is the core of the matter, but there&#8217;s no much to tell in here. Use
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/platform-overview/stable/cairo">cairo</a> to draw, the API is pretty simple. Use cairo primitives to draw
inside the implementation of <code>draw</code> virtual method. There, is given a context
which is clipped from one of the <code>GdkWindow</code> of the widget, you should draw
in that context. Other than this, here are some remarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to draw an icon from the theme into the <code>cairo_context_t</code> ?. Obtain a
<code>GdkPixbuf</code> from the icon with <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/stable/GtkIconTheme.html#gtk-icon-theme-load-icon"><code>gtk_icon_theme_load_icon</code></a> or
<a href="http://developer.ginome.org/gtk/stable/GtkIconTheme.html#gtk-icon-info-load-symbolic"><code>gtk_icon_info_load_symbolic</code></a> depending on the icon, and draw it to the
context with <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gdk/stable/gdk-Cairo-Interaction.html#gdk-cairo-set-source-pixbuf"><code>gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf</code></a></p></li>
<li><p>How do I get my lines subpixel thin ?. Turns out that cairo can draw lines
thinner than one pixel, but for that to happen you need to place the cairo
starting point in the middle of the pixel, so the drawing can be made, and look
just like you want.</p>

<pre><code>/* a vertical 0.3 pixel line */
cairo_set_line_width (cr, 0.3);
cairo_move_to (cr, 10, 10.4);
cairo_rel_line_to (cr, 0, 10);
cairo_stroke (cr);
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, use whenever you need <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkStyleContext.html#gtk-render-background"><code>gtk_render_background</code></a>,
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkStyleContext.html#gtk-render-frame"><code>gtk_render_frame</code></a> family and friends over any alternative drawing you
could think of doing. These functions will get colors and border size
and radius from the CSS theming engine, therefore you&#8217;re spared a bunch of work.</p>

<h4>Processing events</h4>

<p>How to receive and handle mouse, touch and button events. My first attempt
to catching and handling event was to implement virtual method <code>button_press</code>
and <code>button_release</code>, that didn&#8217;t worked. Not that easily.</p>

<p>For catching input events in your custom widget, you will need a <code>GdkWindow</code>
suited for those purposes. The preferred idiom here is:</p>

<ul>
<li>In your <code>realize</code> method, create a <code>GdkWindow</code> with <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gdk/stable/gdk-Windows.html#gdk-window-new"><code>gdk_window_new</code></a> and
set its type to <code>GDK_WINDOW_CHILD</code>, this would assure to catch the input events if
they occur inside you window. After created the window, call
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gdk/stable/gdk-Windows.html#gdk-window-show"><code>gdk_window_show</code></a> to show it. You will use
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gdk/stable/gdk-Windows.html#gdk-window-set-user-data"><code>gdk_window_set_user_data</code></a> to relate the window with your widget.</li>
<li>In your <code>size_allocate</code> method, you need to place the window where it should,
by using <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/gdk/stable/gdk-Windows.html#gdk-window-move-resize"><code>gdk_window_move_resize</code></a>.</li>
<li>Now, you can implement <code>button_press</code> and the likes of them to handle your
events.</li>
</ul>


<p>There are virtual methods for handling mouse button presses, and a releases,
but no for high-level actions as click and double-click, you need to detect those
by detecting sequences of presses and releases. Nonetheless, for double-click the
<code>GdkEventButton</code> will have the type field set to <code>GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS</code> which will
certainly help. For key-press/release events, I have to say, I haven&#8217;t
had nothing to do with those yet. So, that will be left to the next time.</p>

<h4>Putting things together</h4>

<p>I won&#8217;t paste the code entirely, I&#8217;ll just describe the order in which the above
mentioned steps will most likely occur.</p>

<p>Usually, as you must have guessed by now, the first thing your widget will
receive is a request for its preferred size using
<code>gtk_widget_get_preferred_width</code> and friends. After that, the
parent will follow to allocate the size, there your implementation of
<code>size_allocate</code> will run, and then, the painting will happen.
About the <code>realize</code> part, it will happens almost anytime,
the only thing you can be sure of is: it will happens before your widget had to
paint itself. One thing worth mentioning is that a widget could be allocated a
bunch of times before it ever gets to the painting part.</p>

<p>About a full example of code, one the simplest widgets for showing all
of this is <code>GtkButton</code>. You can read the source of in the Gtk+ tree. Here&#8217;s
the header: <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkbutton.h"><code>gtkbutton.h</code></a> and the source <a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtkbutton.c"><code>gtkbutton.c</code></a>. As I said
above, reaching into Gtk+ internals is the best way to learn to use the toolkit
and the framework.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Obviously this a pretty simple post about some of the
more common tasks you&#8217;ll meet with when making a custom widget. There are
several more complex widgets which are far from this, but those are left for
later.</p>

<p>Hope it helps, and if you find any mistake, please contact me immediately so I can
fix it.</p>

			Moving to Fedora</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a> for about 4 years now, and I&#8217;ve been pretty happy
about it. The thing is, as I become more involved in Gnome development, I&#8217;ve feel
the best distro for such a purpose is <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>

<p>Now,  you can argue a bunch of
powerful reasons, but the people who package Gnome in Fedora knows
Gnome internals, so the chance you&#8217;ll end up getting a better experience is
higher. I should tell Gnome packagers in Archlinux to stay a little bit
closer to upstream Gnome developers. Another reason for staying with Arch would
have been to test Gnome across different distros, and I know that would help,
but I felt I needed a change.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another point, since I&#8217;m dedicating more time now to develop stuff, I
spent less time configuring stuff and tweaking my system, I&#8217;m starting to see my
laptop as a tool for development, not the toy it used to be. The only thing I
require of a distro right now is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a package of vim. I&#8217;ll install the plugins myself.</li>
<li>Having gcc/g++ and the man pages of those. Which I found yesterday I don&#8217;t
have in Fedora.</li>
<li>Having devhelp, and GLib/Gtk+ docs.</li>
<li>Ohh, and not having <strong>KDE</strong> installed by default.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, by now, I&#8217;ve been on Fedora for almost a month according to <em>last</em>, and I&#8217;m
pretty happy with it.</p>

<p>See you soon, to let u know some Calendar advances.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been long time since I published any stuff, errr. I&#8217;ve
been busy. So, to the point.</p>

<p>Calendar is moving forward, slower than I would like, but is moving. From the
last time, I&#8217;ve started the implementation of the event-view, and I say started
cause there&#8217;s missing functionality yet, but the widgets part is almost done.
For now, it deletes your events, so be careful, that&#8217;s the only button that
really works. I&#8217;ve set in-place some code to enable notifications, but that will
have to wait a little yet. The toolbar has got some changes,
mostly added behavior to the change between views, and some internal
refactoring.</p>

<p>The most important stuff is: the screenshots you&#8217;ll see below will
show you one thing, the event-view need some redesign to occupy all that empty
space. There&#8217;s host/guest part still missing implementation, but I know it won&#8217;t
fill all the space. On the other hand, I&#8217;ll need some symbolic icon for the
reminders, to show in the views (monthly, daily, etc.). There&#8217;s still the issue
of the navigation controls presentation, which I don&#8217;t like been shown by
pressing <Ctrl>, but that will come eventually.</p>

<p>This work is pretty skeleton-like, there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff that needs to be
retouched, so, any thing you find, feel free to reach me.</p>

<p>Now the shots:
The first one is the month-view, the only one working right now, and the others
are of the event-view.</p>
