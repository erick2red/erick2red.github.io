Since last Friday I'm a proud member of [Planet Gnome][1].
I notice my last two post on Planet Gnome feed, and was a huge joy. After the
initial excitement I realize what a great responsibility encloses the fact of
being able of publish there, and certain fear went deep into my bones.

Anyway, and introduction is mandatory. My name is: Erick PÃ©rez Castellanos, and
I'm a software developer from Cuba. I studied Computer Science like 4 years ago
or so, and I've been using Linux since for ever it seems. I became involved with
Gnome last year, after wanting to for a very long time. I've been contributing
to Contacts, as you can see here in the archive of the blog, and I'm planning to
keep on. So, till next time, I'll see you around.
