*This is post was due for about two weeks ago. I've been very busy, so here it goes.*

GNOME 3.10 was released almost three weeks ago. A huge number changes and improvements were made as you can see in
the [release notes][1]. Those changes affected **Contacts** as well.

This cycle the platform gained client-side decoration support from Gtk+ toolkit. We, in Contacts, also
incorporated a cool [header bar][2], which in our case has the perk of being splitted between the contacts list and
the main contact pane.

The change in Contacts I'm most proud of is the new Change AddressBook dialog. It's an UI change that improved
the experience a lot and [clarified which is the active addressbook][3]

Finally, under the hood, Contacts is starting to use most of the new widgets recently migrated into Gtk+ and
the template support landed this cycle.

**Edit**: I owe you screenshots.
