This should be old news for some, but good news for community I hope. About a
week I uploaded the firsts bits of Gnome Calendar application as sketched
[here][1]. It just do very few stuff, but it's a start. The main design is done,
and I'll keep working on it.

The code was uploaded to github at first, but after talking with gnome's servers
sysadmins we agree the code could be hosted in [git.gnome.org][2].

I'm very happy of getting the project live, I know there's a lot of work ahead,
and I'll be on it alternating with Gnome Contacts' work, which is mostly done by
Alex.

I have to thanks all the gnome hackers for its great response.

Keep in touch.
