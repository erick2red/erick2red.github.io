			Contacts 3.14</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been almost seven months since my last post and much have happened. Across the next posts I&#8217;ll be telling you some of what&#8217;s been and what will come. Yet, today&#8217;s post i about <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Contacts">Contacts</a> and the improvements we made on this cycle and you will see when GNOME 3.14 gets released.</p>

<p>The biggest greatest work on these past months was implementing inline contact creation. For a long time I had Allan&#8217;s mockups lying around, there were, also, some bugs concerning the <em>&#8220;new contact dialog&#8221;</em> and its behavior. So we set the goal to fix those and implement the feature this cycle. Doing this I realize the some internals cleaning in Contacts is in order, but, since feeling it is a big task I decided to delay it and hack our current <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/tree/src/contacts-contact-editor.vala">ContactEditor</a> widget to make it able to work on the new flow.</p>

<p>Down, at the end, are some screenshots.</p>

<p>We also worked a bit on others details. There&#8217;s a list here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated all our dialogs to match latest Gtk+ design</li>
<li>Fixed the header-bar behavior and looks for selection and edit-mode</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs related to changing your default address bug. This included hacking into <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Folks">folks</a> library, a work of which I am very proud.</li>
<li>Improved Adwaita dark variant support: Contacts maintained tweaked css code for colors definitions, we set out to use the defaults provided by the theme in order to work well with both variants.</li>
</ul>


<p>I hope you can enjoy latest version on Contacts when it&#8217;s released. Go, find and bugs and improvements and <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gnome-contacts">let us know</a></p>

<h4>A word on bugs</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to maintain Contacts&#8217; bug list properly tagged and organized. In accomplishing that I&#8217;ve marked some as NEEDINFO, now, it&#8217;s been a while of this. I just wanted to let you know, I&#8217;ll be closing those bugs if they don&#8217;t get any updates before 3.14.1 is out on October 15.</p>

			Presenting GProxies</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been working only from my laptop, and since I&#8217;m moving a lot usually
I find myself in situations where I need to change networks details to properly connect
to Internet. Now, <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a> network configuration system
does a decent job at remembering your network settings across different network.</p>

<p>The thing about this, it&#8217;s that a network profile as defined in <strong>System Settings</strong> does not
keep your proxy configuration for that profile. So I took the task to wrote a small
tool for keeping different proxy configurations and allowing easy switching between them.</p>

<p>The tool is called <a href="https://github.com/erick2red/gproxies">GProxies</a>. It&#8217;s built using latest
<a href="http://www.gtk.org">Gtk+</a>, <strong>GLib</strong> and <strong>Vala</strong>. I tried to use the minimal amount of dependencies
so it won&#8217;t have that much noise.</p>

<p><strong>GProxies</strong> is designed with a very simple plugins system. Plugins are meant for
updating other applications&#8217; configuration whenever you select a different proxy setting
from the interface. For instance: I made a plugin for updating my git&#8217;s <code>http.proxy</code>
config automatically when selecting a different a proxy settings. There are two types
of plugins: one main <em>default plugin</em>, for setting GNOME system settings&#8217; proxy and
the others living inside <code>${XDG_DATA_DIR}/gproxies</code> designed to update other applications
configuration.</p>

<p>A plugin is defined by a folder named after the plugin in <code>${XDG_DATA_DIR}/gproxies</code>
with two or more files in it:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>plugin.ini</code> key-file. More details are explained <a href="https://github.com/erick2red/gproxies/blob/master/PLUGINS.md">here</a>.</li>
<li>an executable script/application which receives proxy details as calling arguments</li>
</ul>


<p>This way you can make plugins for changing the proxy in any applications
you want. I&#8217;ve made another <a href="https://github.com/erick2red/gproxies-plugins">repository</a> with the plugins I&#8217;ve write for myself.</p>

<p>Right now the tool is in a working state. I have some other improvements in mind,
such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add some interface to properly <em>enable/disable</em> plugins</li>
<li>Add the ability to install plugins from zipped files or remote sources</li>
<li>Add a direct-connection (no proxy enabled) state</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like to say how much I enjoyed coding a small application for the GNOME
desktop. Gtk+ toolkit is perfect for this kind of task, with widgets which helps
enforcing GNOME HIG making an application fits properly in the desktop environment.
Also, Vala as a language it&#8217;s really powerful and composite widget templates from Gtk+
really speed up the development process. The code of <strong>GProxies</strong> is pretty simple,
and I guess it would make a nice reading for GNOME developer beginners.</p>

<p>Below, I present some screenshots. I hope someone will find this useful.</p>

			Contacts 3.10</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>This is post was due for about two weeks ago. I&#8217;ve been very busy, so here it goes.</em></p>

<p>GNOME 3.10 was released almost three weeks ago. A huge number changes and improvements were made as you can see in
the <a href="https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.10/">release notes</a>. Those changes affected <strong>Contacts</strong> as well.</p>

<p>This cycle the platform gained client-side decoration support from Gtk+ toolkit. We, in Contacts, also
incorporated a cool <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.10/GtkHeaderBar.html">header bar</a>, which in our case has the perk of being splitted between the contacts list and
the main contact pane.</p>

<p>The change in Contacts I&#8217;m most proud of is the new Change AddressBook dialog. It&#8217;s an UI change that improved
the experience a lot and <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=687220">clarified which is the active addressbook</a></p>

<p>Finally, under the hood, Contacts is starting to use most of the new widgets recently migrated into Gtk+ and
the template support landed this cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I owe you screenshots.</p>

			A Week for Releasing</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve set a deadline for doing a weekly post. Well, last week, I missed. It was a really busy week.
I was building a web-page, and I haven&#8217;t done that in like 10 months or something so I had a lot to
catch up. It was fun, though. I&#8217;m right now looking forward to start playing around with <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2013/6/25/Rails-4-0-final/">Rails 4</a></p>

<p>On the other side my Gnome duties caught up with me. I&#8217;ve been acting as Contacts maintainer with Alex for
a while now. But so far, he was doing the releasing part. I, usually, implemented new stuff, reviewed patches,
fixed bugs, but no more. This past week since Alex is on vacation I had to fill in doing the release.</p>

<p>I was prompted by Matthias Clasen for doing a release of gnome-contacts for the 3.9.4 development release of <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnome.devel.announce/339">Gnome</a>.
In the process, I realized I can&#8217;t log into master.gnome.org for the purposes of uploading the packages. So,
Mathias kindly offered himself to upload the package. Later I got my account authorized, and I was able to release
gnome-contacts-3.8.3. This latter one, I was surprised to see it packaged this morning into Archlinux.</p>

<p>These two releases are only bug fixes, yet there nasty bugs fixed there. You can read the <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-contacts/tree/NEWS">NEWS</a> file, or
the <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-contacts/log/">commit log</a> to find about.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s next on Contacts ? I want to implement New Contact flow inline and get rid of dialog, and close a
bunch of bugs around it. Also, yesterday I got a bug from Allan about updating a bit the selection pattern, and I
would like to work on it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have to thanks Jonh Wendell for his fix of the webcam bug.</p>

			June Update on Calendar</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve made a commitment with myself of posting updates of the stuff I&#8217;m working
once a week. This one is the first, and I expected to be out by Monday, but an
<a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">octopress</a> update and a plugin installation for handling image galleries
kept me from doing it.</p>

<p>By now, I&#8217;m a little tired of writing, therefore I&#8217;ll be quick about it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I restarted the work on <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Calendar">Calendar</a> with the hope of adding a
bunch of new features in <strong>Gtk+</strong> to the project. I started by creating a
new branch, since I was sure the build would break a lot times in between, and
didn&#8217;t want to spoil <strong>master</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d set for myself a bunch of points I want to accomplish by rewriting the UI and
some of them has been done, some others, not yet. That&#8217;s the main reason why I keep
the branch still around. As soon as I feel the work is done, I&#8217;ll come back to work
on <strong>master</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ditch <strong>clutter</strong> dependency. Use only Gtk+ widgets.</li>
<li>Include <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.9/GtkSearchBar.html">GtkSearchBar</a>, <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.9/GtkStack.html">GtkStack</a> and some of the latest Gnome UI guidelines</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.9/GtkBuilder.html">GtkBuilder</a>&#8217;s ui files as much as I can</li>
<li>Rework week-view to use <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.9/GtkOverlay.html">GtkOverlay</a> instead of my own solution</li>
</ol>


<p>So far 1, 2 and 3 has been accomplished. Point number 4 is going well since I manage to
craft a day-view with the same requirements of week-view that does not need to
use <strong>GtkOverlay</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the work done is showcased below</p>
