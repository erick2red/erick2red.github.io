    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When developing an application aiming for everyone worldwide to use, there are certain challenges
you will face. Right now, mine is fighting laziness and locales.</p>

<p>I'm developing some widget for specifying a date and I've been struggling with date formats across locales
So, after reading a huge number of manpages, source-code, and so on I stumble on this code.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  setlocale(LC_ALL,"");
  printf("%s\n",nl_langinfo(D_FMT));
  exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will show me your date format according to your locale.
What I will ask, compile and run this code in your pc, and post the answer here along with your locales.</p>

<p>See you around.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Thxs for the comments. Two things: I've just updated the code, thxs to Tom, adding <strong>setlocale</strong> line made the code works. Second: Thxs to Tommi (first comment). That was the info I was looking for.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been using <a href="http://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a> for about 4 years now, and I've been pretty happy
about it. The thing is, as I become more involved in Gnome development, I've feel
the best distro for such a purpose is <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>.</p>

<p>Now,  you can argue a bunch of
powerful reasons, but the people who package Gnome in Fedora knows
Gnome internals, so the chance you'll end up getting a better experience is
higher. I should tell Gnome packagers in Archlinux to stay a little bit
closer to upstream Gnome developers. Another reason for staying with Arch would
have been to test Gnome across different distros, and I know that would help,
but I felt I needed a change.</p>

<p>There's another point, since I'm dedicating more time now to develop stuff, I
spent less time configuring stuff and tweaking my system, I'm starting to see my
laptop as a tool for development, not the toy it used to be. The only thing I
require of a distro right now is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having a package of vim. I'll install the plugins myself.</li>
<li>Having gcc/g++ and the man pages of those. Which I found yesterday I don't
have in Fedora.</li>
<li>Having devhelp, and GLib/Gtk+ docs.</li>
<li>Ohh, and not having <strong>KDE</strong> installed by default.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, by now, I've been on Fedora for almost a month according to <em>last</em>, and I'm
pretty happy with it.</p>

<p>See you soon, to let u know some Calendar advances.</p>
